# XBMC Watched Flag Helper 2.9

For those Windows users like me who prematurely upgraded to Frodo before checking if they could carry on using the xbmc-watched-data add-on, this .net app can set the watched flag for XBMC videos in either a shared MySQL library or the normal local SQLite .db file.

You can use this app with Frodo to import the watched.xml file created by the old add-on, and also export back out a similar xml file. You don't need to install anything else as I've included all the necessary dlls.

## FAQ
**What is the username and password for the databases?**

The local .db file doesn't need a password, but the username and password for the shared library is normally ‘xbmc’.

**What is the database name?**

The remote database name for XBMC is currently myvideos75. However, this does change when different versions of XBMC are released. Those not using a Windows server may need to capitalise the database name, e.g. MyVideos75.

**Is this app compatible with XBMC 13.0 Gotham?**

Yes - just change the database name to MyVideos78.
